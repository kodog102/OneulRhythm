# Sprint 7 — Notification System (T2)

Date

2026-07-24

## Added

### Notification Plan

- Introduced `NotificationPlan` and `NotificationPlanItem` as pure desired-state models.
- Introduced `NotificationMapper` to transform domain rhythms into a deterministic notification plan.
- Promoted `reminderMinutes` onto domain `Routine` and mapped it through `RoutineEntity`.
- One-time create flow now schedules through `Routine → NotificationMapper → NotificationPlan → NotificationScheduling`.

## Notes

Permission UX and `NotificationService` isolation are unchanged.

Recurring reminder scheduling remains persist-only and out of scope for T2.

Schedule synchronization remains a later Sprint 7 slice.

# Sprint 7 — Notification System (T1)

Date

2026-07-23

## Added

### Notification Trigger Policy

- Introduced `NotificationTriggerPolicy` as the single source of truth for reminder trigger-date calculation.
- One-time create flow in `AddRoutineView` now schedules via the policy instead of inline date arithmetic.
- Unit tests cover missing offset, future, exact-now, past, and near-boundary cases.

## Notes

Permission flow and `NotificationScheduling` isolation are unchanged.

Recurring reminder scheduling remains persist-only and out of scope for T1.

Developer verification completed successfully.

# Sprint 6-5 — Primary Rhythm Ownership

Date

2026-07-23

## Changed

### Today Snapshot

- Moved Primary Rhythm selection into `TodayRhythmSnapshot`.
- Established presentation priority: Current → Past Incomplete → Next.
- TodayViewModel now forwards snapshot-owned primary state instead of selecting focus.
- TodayView renders only the Primary Rhythm without selection logic.
- Live Activity mapper consumes snapshot `primaryRole` for focus.

## Notes

Schedule Engine, Repository, SwiftData models, and Activity lifecycle remain unchanged.

See `Docs/Architecture/Reviews/Sprint6-5_ArchitectureReview.md` and `Docs/SprintReviews/Sprint-6-5.md`.

# Sprint 6-4 — Recurring Rhythm

Date

2026-07-22

## Added

### Recurring Rhythm

- Added Recurring Rhythm support.
- Added Daily, Weekdays, and Weekends recurrence rules.
- Introduced `RecurringRhythmEntity` as the persisted recurring definition.
- Added automatic daily occurrence provisioning from active recurring definitions.
- Added foreground synchronization so today's occurrences stay aligned when the app becomes active.

### Quality

- Runtime QA completed successfully.
- Unit test suite validated at 102 passing tests.

## Notes

Recurring definitions generate daily rhythms before Schedule Engine resolution.

One-time rhythms remain represented by the absence of a recurrence rule.

See `Docs/SprintReviews/Sprint-6-4.md` for the Sprint Review.
